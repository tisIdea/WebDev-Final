      <p>Before Steve Lacy joined the ranks of Grammy-nominated artists, he was just a teenager with an iPhone and a vision. His breakthrough track <em>“Dark Red”</em>, from his 2017 project <em>Steve Lacy’s Demo</em>, was produced almost entirely on his phone using GarageBand. In a world obsessed with high-end studios and expensive gear, Lacy proved that creativity trumps equipment.</p>

      <p>In his TEDxTeen talk titled <em>"The Bare Maximum,”</em> Lacy explained how his minimal setup wasn’t a limitation — it was a playground. With just an iRig to connect his guitar, GarageBand, and his phone’s built-in mic for vocals, he created music that felt raw, immediate, and deeply personal. “Why wait until you have everything?” he asked. “Use what you have now.”</p>

      <p><em>“Dark Red”</em> blends woozy guitar loops, punchy bass, and vulnerable lyrics. The charm lies in its imperfections — slight vocal distortion, fuzzy tones, and simplicity. These aren’t flaws; they’re part of its identity. The song became an underground hit, especially on platforms like TikTok, where it found new life years after its release.</p>

      <p>What makes Lacy’s story so powerful is the message behind it: limitations can spark invention. His phone became a studio, his bedroom a control room. For a generation raised on DIY ethos, his success is proof that you don’t need permission, just purpose.</p>

      <p>Today, Lacy continues to innovate, but the legacy of <em>“Dark Red”</em> remains — a track that challenged the industry’s norms and empowered a new wave of bedroom producers to get started with whatever tools they had.</p>
